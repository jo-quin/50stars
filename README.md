# 50stars

While working on Makers Academy final engineering project [stargazer](https://github.com/jo-quin/stargazer) I was in charge of developing the necessary code to filter which stars and planets should be displayed on the app.

This repository shows my first attempts on building the required functionality.

Even though the stargazer app is built in Swift I decided to use Ruby for the developing process.
Using a language that I knew quite well allowed me to focus on the theoretical concepts used in astronomy to position celestial bodies in the night sky.
